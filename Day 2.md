##### Types of Shells
> They differ in their features
- SH
- BASH
- FISH
- ZSH

- It contains: 
	- *Kernel*
	- *Software*
	- *Desktop Environment*
		- **Mate**
		- **Gnome**
		- **KDE plasma**
		- **XFCE** 
	- *File Extensions*
	- *Window manager*
		- **i3-window-manager**
#### Why Linux?
- Its fast
- Its mostly used OS
- Offers a lot of tools for hacking
- Its secured
#### Linux Distributions/Distro
- Distro is a modified **Linux** kernel with different:
	- *Linux Kernel*
	- *Packages* **(GNU)**
	- *Package Manager*
	- *Desktop UI*

	- Debian
		- Kali Linux
		- Ubuntu
		- parrot
	- Arch
		- Black arch
		- Garuda
	- Fedora
	- Android and many more ....
#### Which one is best for Hackers?
- ***Kali Linux :*** *designed for digital forensic and pentesting. It is maintained and funded by Offensive Security*
	- **Desktop Env:** XFCE
	- **Package manger:** apt
	- **Shell:** ZSH
- ***Parrot OS :*** *focuses on security, privacy and development*
	- **Desktop Env:** Mate
	- **Package manger:** apt
	- **Shell:** BASH
- ***Garuda :*** ** *a Linux distribution based on the Arch Linux operating system.*
	-  **Desktop Env:** KDE plasma
	- **Package manger:** pacman
	- **Shell:** FISH
#### How can we use the *Distro's*?
1. *Main OS/ Main-boot*
2. *Dual Boot /2in1*
3. *Live boot*
4. *Cloud terminals*
5. *Virtual Machines*
6. *WSL / Windows Subsystem for Linux*
