## Introduction to Python Programming
### What is Programming language
- It is a language that help to communicate with machines
	- Ex: *Assembly. C, C++, Java, Python, ....*
- It helps us to write programs using the languages
#### What is Program?
- It is an algorithm expressed in a programming language
- An algorithm is a detailed sequence of actions to perform to accomplish some tasks.
- It must reach a result after a finite number of steps
### Types of programming Languages
- Based on the closeness of the language to humans we classify it into 3
#### 1. Low-Level programming
- These languages are more like machines. They're close to the hardware of the computers.
	- Ex: *Assembly*
#### 2. High-Level programming
- They're more close to human languages
	- Ex: *Python, C, C++, Java, JS*
#### 3. Middle-Level programming
- Languages between low level and high level, they combine both
	- Ex: *C-lang*
### How do High-Level languages work?
- **Compilers:** are tools which helps to convert the whole code to bytecode then computer will execute it.
	- Ex: *C, C++, Java*
- **Interpreter**: can directly execute the code by reading the source code line by line
	- Ex: *Python*
### Uses of Programming Language
- *Web development*
- *Game development*
- *Artificial Intelligence*
- ***Hacking tool development***
#### What is Python Programming
- Python is a high-level and interpreted programming language.
- It is a very simplified language
##### History of Python
- Python was developed by **Guido van Rossum** in the late 80's and 90's at the *National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer* in Netherland
- It is derived from many other languages, including C, C++, Unix shell and other scripting language
##### Uses of Python
- *Data analysis*
- *Machine Learning*
- *Back-end development*
- ***Hacking Script writing***
##### IDE and Code editors
- **IDE:** is a software that helps write and run a specific programming language
- **Code editor:** software those can help to write any kind of programming language
##### Variables
- It is a value holder/container
- The process of giving value to word is called **Variable Declaration**
- The word that holds the data is called **Identifier**
##### Data types
###### Numeric Data types
- *int, float, complex*
###### String Data type
- String is a sequence of characters represented by either single or double quotes
###### Sequence Data
1. **Lists:** is an ordered collection of similar or different types separated by comma and enclosed by "[ ]". To access the list members we use index. We can modify/add objects to the list
2. **Tuple:** an ordered sequence of items same as list. They can't be modified. They can be accessed using index
3. **Dictionary:** an unordered collection of items. It sores elements in key/value pairs. We use key to retrieve the respective value
