## Further on Python
### Function
- A function is a block of code that performs a specific task
#### Types of Functions
- There are two types of function
	- **Standard library functions:** built-in function in Pythons
	- **User-defined functions:** 
#### Return statement
- A Python function may or may not return a value
- If we want our function to return some value we use the **return** statement
### Recursion
- It is a process of defining something in terms of itself. Are functions that call itself.
##### Disadvantage
- RF are hard to debug
- They take up a lot of memory
- The logic behind is hard to follow

### Anonymous/ Lambda Function
- If a function doesn't have a name it is called **Lambda function/Anonymous**
- If you have 1 line code to return you don't need to def a function.
- A lambda function is a special type of function without the function name.
- **Syntax:** *lambda argument(s): expression*
	- Ex: *greet = lambda : print("Hello world)"*
#### Function takers function
- Filter, map and reduce takes function as an argument
##### Filter function
- It is used to filter or search some functions from sequences
##### Map function
- It is used to do some operations on Sequences

### Object-Oriented programming/OOP
- Python is an object oriented programming. This means more things in python are objects
- Objects are anything which can have action and name
- Objects have attributes(properties) and methods(actions and functions)
	- Ex: My Computer is an object because, it have
		- Attribute: name, size, ram
		- Behavior: Running game, displaying text
#### Python Class
- Class is simply a place where we create our Object's attribute and behavior
- It is like a template
- Class is a blue print for an object
#### Python Constructors
#### Python Inheritance
- It is a way of creating new class with some properties of existing class
#### Python Encapsulation
- It refers to bundling of attributes and methods inside a single class
- It allows for better control and protection of the data, ensuring that is accessed and modified only through specified methods
