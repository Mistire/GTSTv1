## Core of Python Programming
#### Slicing
```python
name = 'No 1 is nathan'
print(name[8:14:1])
# Output: Nathan
```
```python
name = ['ethiopia', 'banana', 'china', 'apple']
print(name[-1:0:-2])
# Output: ['apple', 'banana']
```
#### User Input handling
- On python there are two types of inputs
	- By Input function
		- input(f"Text you want to be {displayed}")
	- By Arguments: gets the input from command line
		- import sys
#### Operators
- Arithmetic operators: +, -, /, *
- Assignment Operators: =, -=, +=
- Comparison Operators: = =, <=, >=
- Logical Operators: and, or
- Bitwise Operators: |, &, ^, <<, >>, ~
- Special Operators
#### If/else conditions
#### if..elif..else statements
#### Nested if statements
#### Logical Errors(Exceptions)
- Errors hat could occur at runtime
- For instance, they occur when we
	- Try to call an index that is greater than the list have causes ( IndexError )
	- Try to divide a number by zero (ZeroDivisionError)
	- When you have error on your syntax (NameError) and so on.
- So specially when errors occur on runtime this causes a huge damage on our
program so we have to handle it.
- For handling errors we use try..except blocks
#### Python Loops
-  There are two loops in python:
	- **For Loop:** iterate over any sequence
	- **While Loop:** run a specific code until a certain condition is met. 
- You can exit an infinite loop using **break**
